# Combo box search suggestions

A combo box setup to behave like the search suggestions on the Google home page.

- `onChange` is used to update the value as the user types
- `showSelectedLabel` is enabled to update value as the selects
- `expandOnFocus` is disabled so you have to type of see results
- The highlighter is set to inverse to highlight the completion.

The token search is used here.  In reality the search suggestions would be returned by a search engine.
