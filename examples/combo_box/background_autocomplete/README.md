# Combo box with background autocomplete

This demonstrates the search working like the autocomplete on the Google Mail search bar.

Try typing `in:`, `is:`, `from:` or `to:` for example.

Pressing tab will complete the suggestion.  A disabled 'ghost' input is placed behind the main input to
show the autocomplete suggestion.

> :warning: **Warning** the search suggestions are not accessible to a screen reader
> when drawn on the hidden input.

You can toggle between an accessible version by setting autoselect to `"inline"`.
