# Change log

## Unreleased

- Fixed drop down with only one issue with that issue selected would not show as expanded

## 4.0.0

### Changed

Thanks to recent improvements in browser and screen-reader support it has been possible to make a number of simplifications.

- Remove non-breaking space separators between options as the Mac Chrome bug requiring this has been resolved
- Use aria-labelledby for all option labels involving groups instead of inserting visually hidden text
- Removes the `renderGroupAccessibleLabel` and `renderTableCellColumnAccessibleLabel` from all components
  as these are no longer required
- Removed `managedFocus` option. Focus for screen-readers now entirely uses `aria-activedescendant` which now
  works reliably over all screen-readers
- Switch to the ARIA 1.2 pattern as this now works reliably over all screen-readers
- Adjusted Escape to behave like the aria-practices recommendations. Press once to close and press a second time
  to clear the value.
- Pressing Alt + ArrowUp no longer clears the search value
- A drop down with no options is now focusable

### Fixes

- Fix an issue where drop down aria-live message was prefixed with "undefined"
