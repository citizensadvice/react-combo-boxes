# `<Select>`

Generates an HTML `<select>`, but with a more convenient way of setting the options and responding to changed values.

This uses the same basic props as `<DropDown>` and `<ComboBox>` and they maybe used somewhat interchangeably.

> :warning: Some users find `<select>` controls difficult to use.  A radio group may be more appropriate.

## Usage

This is a stateless controlled component.  You must respond to `onValue` or `onChange` to update the selected value.

```js
const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);

<Select
  options={options}
  value={value}
  onValue={setValue}
/>
```
